## About ##
  Ever wondered whether you should have bought the individual stock that you thought was going to hit it big, or just bought a mutual fund instead? Now you can find out! MyIndex is a stock purchase tracking application that allows you to input your stock purchases and track how well you do against the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average!

## Why? ##
  As an investor, I often find myself asking whether or not that individual stock I purchased has done better than the overall market. I've looked for an online tool to help me answer that question and have come up empty. I built this tool for others like me who take a vested interest in the stock market and love to see whether they can beat the market!

## Solution ##
  As a user of MyIndex, you can input individual stock purchases that you have made over the past 10+ years. Upon entering a purchase, MyIndex will pull historical data for VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 Mutual Fund), QQQ (PowerShares NASDAQ Mutual Fund), and DIA (SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF). Using the historical data, MyIndex calculates how well that specific purchase has done against these three mutual funds. A postive percentage means that your purchase has beaten the index over that time. A negative percentage means you probably should have just bought the mutual fund instead of that cool IPO you thought was going to be big :). Now get out there and beat the market!
